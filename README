If you actually want to use this you'll need to change the local

A basic spotify remote, allows your phone/tablet to control your mac spotify client. I rushed this up to show Spotify's dev evangalist, it's pretty rough.

It uses, Django, spotipy, appscript jquery mobile.

How to:
1) put in a folder 
2) pip spotipy and appscript
3) Forward a router's ports.
4) python manage.py runserver [yourlocalip]:8000


Todo
+ Add song time
+ Add polling for current song / songtime
+ Add smart polling so that once the current song is done playing it checks for a new song
+ Adjust UI so it makes more sense
+ Remove spotipy and just use appscript / add more features to Spotipy( Song time check, current song title)
+ add cover art
+ make mute not lame
