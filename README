If you actually want to use this you'll need to change the local 

"/Users/joeconyers/sites/SpotifyController/templates" to your local directory.
=======
V.03

A basic spotify remote, allows your phone/tablet to control your mac spotify client. I rushed this up to show Spotify's dev evangalist, it's pretty rough.

It uses, Django, spotipy, appscript, and jquery mobile.

Dependencies:
pip install spotipy 
pip install appscript

howto:
1) Forward your router's ports to 8000(or whatever you want to set the ports to) to the computer where this app and spotify is running.
2) python manage.py runserver [yourlocalip]:[Your Preferred Port, probably 8000]


Todo
+ Add polling for current song / songtime 
+ Add better polling so that once the current song is done playing it checks for a new song
+ Adjust UI so it makes more sense
+ Remove spotipy and just use appscript OR add more features to Spotipy( Song time check, current song title)
+ add cover art
+ make mute not lame

Protip: Add dyndns to your router so you don't have to remember to turn on your phone's wifi.
