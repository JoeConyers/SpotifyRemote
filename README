If you actually want to use this you'll need to change the local 

"/Users/joeconyers/sites/SpotifyController/templates" to your local directory.

V.03

A basic spotify remote, allows your phone/tablet to control your mac spotify client. I rushed this up to show Spotify's dev evangalist, it's pretty rough.

It uses, Django, spotipy, appscript, and jquery mobile.

How to:
1) put in a folder 
2) pip install spotipy and pip install appscript
3) Forward your router's ports to 8000(or whatever you want to set the ports to) on the machine you
4) python manage.py runserver [yourlocalip]:[Your Preferred Port]
5) navigate to localhost or your local ip.

Todo
+ Add polling for current song / songtime
+ Add smart polling so that once the current song is done playing it checks for a new song
+ Adjust UI so it makes more sense
+ Remove spotipy and just use appscript / add more features to Spotipy( Song time check, current song title)
+ add cover art
+ make mute not lame
