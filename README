V.01

A basic spotify remote. I rushed this up to show Spotifies dev evangalist.

It uses, Django, spotipy 

KNOWN ISSUES
+App crashes if it loads while a song is not being played due to not having a conditional around checking what song is currently being played

Todo
+ Add song time
+ Add polling for current song / songtime
+ Add smart polling so that once the current song is done playing it checks for a new song
+ Adjust UI so it makes more sense
+ Remove spotipy and just use appscript / add more features to Spotipy( Song time check, current song title)
+ add cover art
